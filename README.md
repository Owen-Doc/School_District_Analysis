# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide summary metrics of a school districts performance to provide organized data to a school board. This analysis looks at student's academic performance in 15 high schools, and accounts for the schools size, budget, the type of school that it is. Students are graded on their standardized test scores in reading and math. I also present an average for each subject, as well as overall passing as determined by a passing grade in both reading in math. I present a district level and school level summary of this data, so that school board members can make budgeting choices, or determine if corrective action is needed for poor performing schools. I was made aware of a data integrity issue for the ninth graders at Thomas High School - these results were voided in my analysis for purposes of determining averages, but these students were kept in for budgetary purposes.
